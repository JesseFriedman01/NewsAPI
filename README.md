# News API Demo 

News API (https://newsapi.org/) is "a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web".

This script was created to demonstrate how to make a request for articles based on a company's name, within the past N number of days. A list is returned with the article's URL, title, source and publishing date. 

A practical application of this can be seen on a portfolio site that I created -- http://165.227.89.136/stocks/

Note: To use this script, you need to:

1. Obtain a free API key from News API (https://newsapi.org/register).

1. Create and save "config.py" in the same directory as "NewsAPI_demo.py" and add the following line:
`	 api_key ="your API key"`
